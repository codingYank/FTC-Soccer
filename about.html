						Hello and welcome! You may know me from Twitter(@thetylerschmidt) or you may have stumbled upon this website some other way, in either case, I'm happy you're here. This website is a project I'm working on as I teach myself web development. Since I'm in the early learning stages, I ask for your patience as I continue to add new features and fix issues. If you have any suggestions, critiques, or any sort of comment, please reach out either through my Twitter, or you can contact me on the contact page.
					</p>
					<p>
						My vision for this site is to be a place for me to create some original content as well as a place to pool all of the wonderful creators that make up the US Soccer community. I even hope to have a forum-type section so we can all debate some of the hottest topics in American soccer with minimal restrictions. For right now, head over to the creators section and check out their content. If you are a content creator, and I have neglected to include you, please contact me so I can add you.
